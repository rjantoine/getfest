      <p>On <strong>February 11, 1990</strong> two very important events were celebrated: The release of Nelson  Mandela from prison in South Africa and the birth of Movements: The Afro-Caribbean Dance Ensemble here in Edmonton. On <strong>February 11, 2010</strong> these two very  important occasions were celebrated once again, this time to mark the 20th  anniversary of the release of former President Nelson Mandela from prison and  Movements’ 20th birthday. Students, teachers, federal, provincial  and  municipal representatives, along  with other invited guests from across the city joined in this extraordinary  celebration at the Shaw Conference Centre to kick off GETfest 2010. </p>
      <p>Driven by our youth steering committee made up of  leadership students from several local schools, GETfest (Getting Everyone  Together Youth fest) brought students together in an inspiring, multicultural,  all-morning session built on two of Mandela’s strongest characteristics:  TENACITY AND RESILIENCE. The event featured two exciting keynote speakers<strong>, CFL Hall of Fame legend, Henry “Gizmo”  Williams</strong> and <strong>International 4Real  filmmaker, Josh Thome</strong>, as well as an audio/visual presentation through  which the students discovered the significance of the life and times of Mandela  and entertainment in the form of music and dance.</p>
      <p> A major  highlight of the event was one of our future bright leaders who introduced the<strong>27  PROJECT</strong> themed <strong>“Winning from the  Inside; Take Charge, Bounce Back, Rise Up!”</strong> She challenged and encouraged  all participating schools to accept their social responsibility by giving back  to their communities, the city of Edmonton and ultimately  our country. <br />

          <p>This<strong> interactive program</strong> focuses on student  engagement whereby students will interact with their inner selves, other  students, citywide, and members of their communities. Through various types of  student-led service activities, they will examine their internal environments,  be empowered to take responsibility for their decisions, be motivated to </p></td>

      <p>find  the courage and determination to persist in the face of challenges, and keep  moving forward regardless of the state of their external environments.  The students will perform their service over  27 days – with each day of service representing one year Mr. Mandela spent in  prison.  </p>
      <p>Participating students will document their projects  and at the end of the 27 days an “electronic quilt” will be woven together from  each submission. The quilt “pieces” will be composed of still photographs,  written word, or a video depicting the youth and the progress through their  chosen project.  The quilt will be  unveiled in April 2010 to correspond with International Youth Service Day and  will then be presented to the Nelson Mandela Foundation in South Africa.<br />
